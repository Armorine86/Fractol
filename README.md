## A Simple fractal explorer featuring three Popular fractals using MinilibX graphic library

The constraints were as follows:<br/>
• The software should offer the Julia set and the Mandelbrot set.<br/>
• The mouse wheel zooms in and out, almost infinitely (within the limits of the computer).<br/>
• It use at least a few colors to show the depth of each fractal.<br/>
• A parameter is passed on the command line to define what type of fractal will be viewed. If no parameter is provided, or if the parameter is invalid, the program displays a list of available parameters and exits properly.<br/
• ESC will exit the program.<br/>

Bonus part :<br/>
• One or more different fractal.<br/>
• The zoom follows the actual mouse position.<br/>
• In addition to the zoom: moving with the arrows.<br/>
• The color range shift.<br/>

### You can add mouse_look, after the chosen fractal, as a parameter to the program to dinamically transform the image!
I.E.: ./fractol mandelbrot mouse_look
